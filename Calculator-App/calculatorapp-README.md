# Calculator App

## Description

This project aims to improve my web-development skills. I try to use more vh and % instead of px to make the calculator responsive without many media queries. Unlike the snake-game project, I did not watch any YouTube videos. Here, I code from scratch with whatever I have learnt from school and the snake-game project.
