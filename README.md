# Snake-Game
https://shskjssk10.github.io/Snake-Game/

## Description
This project is meant for me to improve my JS skills. I only ever watched a LinkedIn course on JS fundamentals and thats about it. 
Because of that, I decided to follow a guided video on how to make a snake game. I watched parts of it and then tried to recreate the parts that I just watched, at the same time trying to understand how it works. Link to it is at the bottom. 

## EXTRAS
Apart from the features that are implemented through the video, I implemented Local Storage where your own personal high score remains even after you close the site. Just applying some things I learned in school.
