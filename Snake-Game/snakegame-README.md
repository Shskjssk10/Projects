# Snake-Game

## Description
This project is meant for me to improve my JS skills. I only ever watched a LinkedIn course on JS fundamentals and thats about it. 
Because of that, I decided to follow a guided video on how to make a snake game. I watched parts of it and then tried to recreate the parts that I just watched, at the same time trying to understand how it works. Link to it is at the bottom. 

## EXTRAS
Apart from the features that are implemented through the video, I implemented settings where you can change the aesthetics of the game should you wish to.
